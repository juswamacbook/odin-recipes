        <p>
            I'm sharing my version of the hot ube pandesal.<br>
            We ate for breakfast as kids and even for merienda (snack time), with hot chocolate or warm milk.<br> 
            I love food with ube flavor, so I incorporated it into my favorite breakfast bread.><br>
            I know there are many pandesal recipes online, but I hope you try this and let me know what you think.<br>
            Thank you! Serve hot with or without the spread of your choice.<br>
            Warm leftovers in a toaster oven before serving for better taste.<br>
